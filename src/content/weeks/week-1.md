# Week 1

This week, we got introduced to the class, started building our websites, and brainstormed some final project ideas.

## Final project ideas

1. 🐝🐜 Insect swarm: a collection of small autonomous drones that move based on some simple set of rules. Together, they hopefully display some emergent flocking or swarm behavior. See [Flocking Boids (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).

2. 🚗🥛 Drink carrier: a remote-controlled (or autonomous) car that can carry around drinks in a gimbal for spill-free transportation of drinks.

3. 🤖🧹 Tabletop Roomba: to clean up dust on a desk.
