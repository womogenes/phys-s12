This week, we got introduced to the class, started building our websites, and brainstormed some final project ideas.

## Final project ideas

1. 🐝🐜 Insect swarm: a collection of small autonomous drones that move based on some simple set of rules. Together, they hopefully display some emergent flocking or swarm behavior. See [Flocking Boids (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).

2. 🚗🥛 Drink carrier: a remote-controlled (or autonomous) car that can carry around drinks in a gimbal for spill-free transportation of drinks.

3. 🤖🧹 Tabletop Roomba: to clean up dust on a desk. May integrate with a camera to detect when the user is away from their desk and operate when they aren't around.

## Making the site

I decided to try out a new popular static site generator (SSG) called [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's unique in that it uses [Component Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/), which allow a static page to use components from many different frameworks. I'm still not entirely familiar with how it works, but I like it so far! It's a little slower than [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), the SSG I'm used to, but its feature set and documentation are slightly richer.
