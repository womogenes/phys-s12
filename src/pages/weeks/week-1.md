# Final project proposal ideas

1. 🐝🐜 Insect swarm: a collection of small autonomous drones (flying or otherwise) that move based on some simple set of rules. Together, they hopefully display some emergent flocking or swarm behavior. Additional links:

2. 🚗🥛 Drink carrier: a remote-controlled (or autonomous) car that can carry around drinks in a gimbal for spill-free transportation of drinks.
